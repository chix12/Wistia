        <h4>Are there any limits?</h4>
        <p>The Free Plan has room for five videos and comes with 200GB of <span>bandwidth</span> per month. After you've uploaded 5 videos, you can upgrade to <span>paid plan </span> for more space. If your videos exeed 200GB of bandwidth in a given month, they'll stop paying until your bandwidth restets at the start of the next month. Don't worry tho, we've found that 200GB of monthly bandwidth is enough for 95% of all users.</p>
